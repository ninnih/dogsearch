## About DogSearch
Note! DogSearch is not a real company and the dogs you see on the website is not up for adoption. DogSearch is merly a community concept developed for people that are looking to adopt a dog or have adopted a dog and wish to stay in touch with likeminded people. 

## How it works
On DogSearch, you can find dogs that would be up for adoption in a real scenario, view their profiles to learn more, create your own profile and then be able to send adoption and meeting requests and much more. It works as a service and a community all in one. Currently the working functionalities are:
- Google log-in.
- Search database.
- View search results.
- Create profile.
- Change profile image.
However a lot of UX and ideas for other services and functionalities have been considered and implemented as visuals. 

## About Us
